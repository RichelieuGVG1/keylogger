## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `pynput` lib
- `tzlocal` lib

## Usage

The KeyLogger is a script that logs all your keyboard presses/releases and mouse clicks/scrolls. Just run [key.py](key.py) and the logging is started!

All data is encrypted and compressed. You can set the path to a log file by modifying the `LOGPATH` in [config.py](config.py).

To convert the log to text use the [delog.py](delog.py). Just run it.
